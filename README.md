# election_2018_forecast

Here is my forecast. Russia is targeting candidates and sharing propaganda to meddle in the midterms. The White House, which we have all seen, has a strong affinity for Russia and has decided to remain silent on this. Despite this, there is something in the air. Civic engagement and voter turnout are at record highs for any midterm season. Everywhere you go, you're being told to vote. The more people vote, the more democratic the electorate looks. Therefore, I predict the Democrats EASILY take BOTH the House and the Senate. At the end of it all, Democrats will have 51 seats to Republicans 49 and around 220 seats in the House. Specifically, #Beto will beat Ted Cruz in Texas and Bill Nelson should also win in Florida. Though Republicans will likely hold traditionally red districts, Kentucky's 6th and Maine's 2nd will absolutely flip. Also relevant but unrelated to Congress, Stacey Abrams will win in Georgia and become the nation's FIRST African American female governor. Don't drown in the coming blue wave...
